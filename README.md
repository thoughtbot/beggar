### What is Pester?

Pester is a tool to help with getting pull request reviews. Once you have set up
Pester on your repo, new pull requests will be posted to Pester according to
their tags. These tags will also be used to determine which Slack room Pester
will post to.

If the PR does not have a "Sign off" of "LGTM", it will be reposted to the same
rooms again after 30 minutes. The time threshold to repost can be configured
using the ENV var, `REPOST_THRESHOLD`.

To make sure your PR goes to the correct place, your PR description should
include tags like `#rails #javascript #design`. Pester will parse and send to
all the appropriate rooms!

Pester also provides a web interface that allows you to view open PRs for your
group and filter them by tag. This makes it very easy to grab a pull request in
your downtime for whatever tag you prefer.

### Authentication

Pester uses GitHub teams for controlling access to the web interface. When
setting up the app, you should set the `GITHUB_TEAM_ID` environment variable to
the team id that will have access.

There is no User model and users are not tracked in anyway.

While creating a new app in the GitHub, you should specify the following url as
an application callback url:

    https://<your-host>/auth/githubteammember/callback

The easiest way to get the `GITHUB_TEAM_ID` is to use the GitHub API:

    % curl -H "Authorization: token <your-authorization-token>" https://api.github.com/orgs/<your-organization>/teams

The authorization token can be created [on this GitHub page].

### Local Development

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].

[this script]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].
